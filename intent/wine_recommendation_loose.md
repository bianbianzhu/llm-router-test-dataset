## Wine Recommendation (Loose)

**Definition:**

This intent captures a broad range of user inquiries related to finding or getting suggestions for **any type of alcoholic grape beverage**. The user's language might be informal, indirect, or conversational. This includes, but is not limited to:

-   **Vague Inquiries**: Users asking for "something to drink," "a good bottle," or just mentioning "wine" without a clear question.
-   **Implicit Pairings**: Mentioning a food item and expecting a wine suggestion (e.g., "I'm having chicken tonight").
-   **Occasion-Based Hints**: Alluding to an event or mood (e.g., "It's my anniversary," "I need something for a party," "Something to relax with").
-   **Broad Preferences**: Expressing general tastes like "something dry," "a sweet wine," or "a bold red."
-   **Any Mention of Wine Types**: Simply stating a type of wine, region, or grape (e.g., "Merlot," "Italian wine," "Chardonnay").
-   **Questions about what's "good" or "popular"**: Asking about popular, well-regarded, or trendy wines.

**Key Notes:**

-   This definition is intentionally broad. It should include queries that don't perfectly fit the strict definition but are clearly about getting a wine suggestion.
-   Assume `wine_recommendation` if the user mentions a type of wine, a food they are eating, or an occasion, even if they don't explicitly ask for a recommendation.
-   This intent can overlap with general conversational queries. If wine is a central theme, lean towards this intent.

**Examples:**

-   "I feel like having some wine."
-   "We're doing pasta for dinner, what should we open?"
-   "Got anything for a celebration?"
-   "Just a bottle of red, please."
-   "Tell me about a popular white wine."
-   "Something not too expensive."
-   "French reds."
-   "What are people drinking these days?"
