## Wine Recommendation

**Definition:**

This intent covers all user requests for **wine recommendations**. This includes, but is not limited to:

-   **General Recommendations**: Asking for any wine recommendation.
-   **Recommendations by Type**: Requests for specific types of wine (e.g., red, white, ros√©, sparkling).
-   **Recommendations by Food Pairing**: Asking for a wine that pairs well with a specific dish (e.g., steak, fish, pasta).
-   **Recommendations by Occasion**: Seeking a wine for a particular event (e.g., a party, a celebration, a casual dinner).
-   **Recommendations by Price Range**: Inquiries for wine within a certain budget.
-   **Recommendations by Region or Grape**: Requests for wine from a specific country or made from a particular grape variety.

**Key Notes:**

-   This intent is strictly for recommendations. Inquiries about where to buy wine, wine prices (without a recommendation context), or general facts about wine should be handled by other intents.
-   If the user asks for a recommendation and also mentions a specific store or location, the primary intent is still `wine_recommendation`.

**Examples:**

-   "Can you recommend a good red wine?"
-   "What wine should I pair with grilled salmon?"
-   "I'm looking for a cheap but decent bottle of white wine."
-   "Suggest a French wine for a dinner party."
-   "What's a good sparkling wine to celebrate with?"
