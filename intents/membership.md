## Membership

**Definition:**

This intent covers all inquiries related to **membership benefits, perks, and associated programs**, including but not limited to:

- **Benefit Status & Eligibility**: Monthly perks, special benefits, birthday rewards, and tier-based benefits (e.g., checking usage eligibility, viewing membership points including remaining balance, confirming validity period, checking coupons/codes, etc.).
- **Targeted Programs**: Benefits exclusive to specific age groups (e.g., youth/teen/college-only programs).
- **Activity-Based Discounts**: Discounts for cultural events (e.g., exhibitions, performances, musicals, plays).
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Situation-based recommendations (e.g., for dates, families, holidays) and recommendations based on usage history.
- **Coupon Management**: Checking available coupons.
- **Partner Offers**: Inquiries about benefits/discounts/coupons provided via associated partner brands across various categories such as travel, dining, shopping, sports, and services.
- **Partnership Clarification**: Even when third-party brands are mentioned, any question about their relationship to the membership program (e.g., partnership status) is classified as Membership.
- **Common Phrases**: Phrases like “Benefits provided by the program,” “Is this possible with membership?”, “Is there a partnered membership for ~?”, “Tell me the membership benefits for ~” are all treated as Membership.

**Key Notes:**

- If a "membership benefit" question is actually about core service features (e.g., mobile data, specific digital content subscriptions, value-added packs, events, or device insurance), classify it as **Customer Support** instead of **Membership**.
- Questions about _how to use_ membership (e.g., instructions or procedures, not the benefits themselves) and general program features should be classified as **FAQ**.
- Unless it pertains to long-term benefit coupons or device upgrade benefits, any inquiry containing the keyword "benefit" should generally be classified as **Membership**.

**Examples:**

- “What’s my membership tier?”
- “Tell me what coupons I have.”
- “What benefits are included in membership?”
- “Are there benefits for teens?”
- “Are there any benefits for weekend use?”
- “Can I get a coffee shop discount with membership?”
