## Book Venue (Loose)

**Definition:**

This intent is for when someone wants to **book a place**. It could be for anything - a party, a meal, a place to stay, or somewhere to play a sport.

This includes things like:

- **Places for events**: "need a place for a party", "book a meeting room"
- **Food places**: "get a table at a restaurant", "reserve a spot for dinner"
- **Fun places**: "book a tennis court", "can i get a lane at the bowling alley"
- **Places to stay**: "book a hotel", "need a room for the night"
- **Work places**: "rent a desk for a day", "get a workspace"

**Key Notes:**

- If they're just asking if a place exists, it's probably not this intent. This is for when they want to actually make a booking.
- Asking about price or if a place is free is part of booking.

**Examples:**

- "book a room"
- "reserve a table"
- "need a venue for a wedding"
- "get me a spot at the bar"
- "how much to book the hall?"
- "is the conference room free on friday?"
