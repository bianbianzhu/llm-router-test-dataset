## FAQ

**Definition:**

This intent is for general questions about **how to use a service, its features, or policies**. It acts as a catch-all for informational queries that don't fit into more specific transactional or support intents.

This includes, but is not limited to, questions about:

- **How-To & Instructions**: Questions about how to perform a specific action, how to use a feature, or where to find certain information.
- **General Information**: Inquiries about the service's policies, terms of service, pricing, or capabilities.
- **Troubleshooting**: Basic troubleshooting questions that can be answered with standard information.
- **Account Management**: General questions about account settings, profiles, and subscriptions.

**Key Notes:**

- If a question is about a specific, ongoing issue with a user's account or order (e.g., "My order is late"), it should be classified under a more specific intent like "delivery status" or "customer support".
- FAQ questions are typically those that can be answered by a static knowledge base or help document.

**Examples:**

- "How do I reset my password?"
- "What is your return policy?"
- "Can I use this service on multiple devices?"
- "How do I update my payment information?"
- "Where can I find my past invoices?"
