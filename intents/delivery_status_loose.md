## Delivery Status (Loose)

**Definition:**

This intent broadly covers any user query related to **finding out where their stuff is or when it will arrive**. It's about the journey of an item after an order is placed.

This can include, but isn't limited to, questions about:

- **Finding a package**: "Where's my order?", "Track my stuff."
- **Delivery time**: "When will I get my package?", "Is it arriving today?"
- **Confirmation**: "Did you guys drop it off?", "I want to see the delivery photo."
- **Problems**: "My package is stuck somewhere.", "Still haven't received my order."
- **General info**: "Who's delivering my order?", "Just checking on my delivery."

**Key Notes:**

- This is for questions about a delivery that's already in progress. If the user wants to change something (like the address) or ask about shipping prices, it's probably a different intent.

**Examples:**

- "my order status"
- "track shipment 12345abc"
- "is it here yet?"
- "what's the holdup with my delivery?"
- "eta on my package?"
- "any update on my order?"
