## Event

**Definition:**

This intent captures a broad range of user inquiries and actions related to various **happenings and occasions**. It's designed to be flexible and encompass casual or indirect questions about events, not just formal requests.

This includes, but is not limited to:

- **General Interest & Exploration**: Casual questions about what's going on, seeking suggestions for activities, or looking for any type of social gathering.
- **Reservations & Attendance**: Inquiries about securing a spot, booking tickets, signing up, or canceling attendance for any event.
- **Details & Logistics**: Questions about the specifics of an event, such as its nature, who will be there, what it's about, and any rules or guidelines involved.

**Key Notes:**

- This 'loose' definition is intended to catch a wider variety of user queries. Even if a user's request is vague or doesn't use specific keywords like 'event' or 'ticket', if it implies interest in attending or learning about a gathering, it should be classified here.
- Be cautious with inquiries that mention discounts or membership benefits for cultural events (like exhibitions, concerts, etc.), as those might be better classified under the **Membership** intent.

**Examples:**

- "Anything fun to do around here?"
- "I need to get a ticket for that thing next week."
- "What's the deal with that big meeting everyone's talking about?"
- "Is there a festival or something happening soon?"
- "I can't make it to the party, how do I cancel?"
