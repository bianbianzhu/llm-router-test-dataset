## FAQ (Loose)

**Definition:**

This intent is for when people ask **general questions** about how things work, what the rules are, or how to do something. It's for the kind of stuff you'd find in a help section.

This can include questions like:

- **How to do stuff**: "how do i change my email?", "where is the setting for..."
- **Rules and info**: "what are the rules for returns?", "tell me about your prices"
- **Fixing simple problems**: "my app is acting weird", "why can't I log in?"
- **Account questions**: "how do subscriptions work?", "questions about my account"

**Key Notes:**

- If someone is asking about a specific problem they are having right now (like "my order is missing"), it's probably not an FAQ.
- Think of these as questions that have a standard answer.

**Examples:**

- "password reset"
- "return policy?"
- "how much does it cost"
- "help with my account"
- "how can I contact support?"
- "general questions"
