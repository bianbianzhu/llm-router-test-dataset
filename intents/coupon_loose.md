# Intent: Coupon (Loose)

## Definition

This intent captures a wide range of user queries related to **savings, deals, and promotions**. The language used may be less direct and more conversational.

- **General Inquiries**: Vague questions about getting a better price or saving money.
- **Implicit Requests**: Hints or suggestions about wanting a discount without explicitly asking for a "coupon" or "discount."
- **Contextual Clues**: Mentions of budget constraints or desire for a "deal."

> **Note**: This version is designed to be more inclusive, capturing queries that are semantically related to discounts but may not use specific keywords.

## Examples

- "Any way to save some money on this?"
- "Is this the best price you can do?"
- "Hook me up with a deal."
- "I'm on a budget, any help?"
- "Got any specials running?"
