## Book Venue

**Definition:**

This intent covers all user requests to **book, reserve, or inquire about booking a physical space or venue**. This includes a wide range of locations for various purposes.

This includes, but is not limited to, requests concerning:

- **Event Spaces**: Booking venues for parties, conferences, weddings, meetings, or other events.
- **Dining**: Reserving a table at a restaurant, cafe, or bar.
- **Recreational Facilities**: Booking sports courts (like tennis or basketball), swimming pools, or other recreational areas.
- **Accommodation**: Reserving rooms in hotels, motels, or other lodging establishments.
- **Workspaces**: Booking co-working spaces, meeting rooms, or office spaces.

**Key Notes:**

- This intent is about the action of booking or reserving. Simple inquiries about a venue's existence or location (e.g., "Is there a restaurant near me?") should be classified under a different intent like "search".
- Questions about the cost of booking or availability should be included in this intent as they are part of the booking process.

**Examples:**

- "I'd like to book a conference room for next Tuesday."
- "Can I reserve a table for two at 7 PM tonight?"
- "I need to book a hotel room in New York from the 5th to the 9th."
- "Are there any party venues available for this Saturday?"
- "How much does it cost to rent the basketball court for an hour?"
