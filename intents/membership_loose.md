## Membership (Loose)

**Definition:**

This intent broadly covers any inquiries that appear to be related to **membership, benefits, rewards, or loyalty programs**. The definition is intentionally loose to capture a wide range of user queries, including those that are vague, incomplete, or tangentially related to membership.

- **General Benefits**: Questions about any kind of perk, discount, offer, or advantage.
- **Program Status**: Inquiries about tiers, points, status, or levels in any program.
- **Coupons and Vouchers**: Any mention of coupons, codes, or vouchers, even without explicit connection to a membership program.
- **Partner-related Questions**: Queries that mention other brands in the context of potential benefits or partnerships.
- **Ambiguous Inquiries**: Vague questions that could imply a query about membership benefits.

**Key Notes:**

- This version is designed to be more inclusive. It will capture queries that might be misclassified by a stricter definition.
- The goal is to cast a wider net and then potentially use a secondary classification step to narrow down the intent if needed.

**Examples:**

- "my status?"
- "any deals?"
- "what are the perks for me?"
- "can i get a discount at that coffee place?"
- "do i have any points?"
- "youth benefits"
