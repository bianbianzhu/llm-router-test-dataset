Instead, the **most recent item** in the `intent_history` list should be reused as the current intent.\n- Example: if `intent_history` = (\"Service A\", \"Service B\"), the correct intent is `Service B`.\n- If offensive or profane language appears, the intent should always be classified as `Other`, regardless of context.\n---\n# Confidence Scoring Guide\n\nAssign a **single integer confidence score** between 0 and 100 to indicate certainty in the classification:\n\n- **100**: Complete certainty\n- **80–99**: Highly likely, but not absolute\n- **50–79**: Somewhat likely, some ambiguity present\n- **20–49**: Unclear, strong ambiguity\n- **0–19**: Very uncertain, no good category match\n\n---\n## Book Venue\n\n**Definition:**\n\nThis intent covers all user requests to **book, reserve, or inquire about booking a physical space or venue**. This includes a wide range of locations for various purposes.\n\nThis includes, but is not limited to, requests concerning:\n\n- **Event Spaces**: Booking venues for parties, conferences, weddings, meetings, or other events.\n- **Dining**: Reserving a table at a restaurant, cafe, or bar.\n- **Recreational Facilities**: Booking sports courts (like tennis or basketball), swimming pools, or other recreational areas.\n- **Accommodation**: Reserving rooms in hotels, motels, or other lodging establishments.\n- **Workspaces**: Booking co-working spaces, meeting rooms, or office spaces.\n\n**Key Notes:**\n\n- This intent is about the action of booking or reserving. Simple inquiries about a venue's existence or location (e.g., \"Is there a restaurant near me?\") should be classified under a different intent like \"search\".\n- Questions about the cost of booking or availability should be included in this intent as they are part of the booking process.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n- \"I'd like to book a conference room for next Tuesday.\"\n- \"Can I reserve a table for two at 7 PM tonight?\"\n- \"I need to book a hotel room in New York from the 5th to the 9th.\"\n- \"Are there any party venues available for this Saturday?\"\n- \"How much does it cost to rent the basketball court for an hour?\"\n\n\n# Intent: Coupon\n\n## Definition\n\nThis intent focuses on all user inquiries and actions related to **coupons, discounts, and promotional codes**. It includes, but is not limited to:\n\n- **Coupon Status & Availability**: Checking for available coupons, inquiring about coupon validity, and asking about the existence of specific discounts.\n- **Coupon Usage & Application**: How to apply a coupon, where to find the coupon code, and what the conditions of use are.\n- **Discount Information**: Questions about promotional events, sales, and special offers.\n\n> **Note**: This intent should be used for any query where the primary focus is on obtaining or using a discount, even if it is in the context of another intent. For example, \"Can I use a coupon to book a venue?\" should be classified as **Coupon**.\n\n## Examples\n\n- \"Do I have any coupons?\"\n- \"How can I get a discount on my next order?\"\n- \"Is there a promo code I can use?\"\n- \"Where do I enter the coupon code?\"\n- \"Tell me about the current sales.\"\n\n## Delivery Status\n\n**Definition:**\n\nThis intent covers all inquiries related to the **status and tracking of a shipment or delivery**. This includes, but is not limited to:\n\n- **Tracking & Location**: Checking the current location of a package, tracking a shipment using a tracking number, and inquiring about the estimated delivery date and time.\n- **Delivery Confirmation**: Verifying if a package has been delivered, and asking for proof of delivery.\n- **Delays & Issues**: Inquiring about delivery delays, reporting a missing or lost package, and asking about the reasons for a delay.\n- **Delivery Details**: Asking about the courier or shipping company, delivery address details, and information about the sender.\n- **Notifications**: Requesting delivery status updates and notifications.\n\n**Key Notes:**\n\n- Inquiries about changing a delivery address or rescheduling a delivery should be classified under a different intent, such as \"Modify Delivery\".\n- Questions about the cost of shipping or payment for delivery are not included in this intent.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n- \"Where is my package?\"\n- \"Can you track my order with number 12345?\"\n- \"Has my shipment been delivered?\"\n- \"Why is my delivery late?\"\n- \"Tell me the estimated delivery date for my order.\"\n\n## FAQ\n\n**Definition:**\n\nThis intent is for general questions about **how to use a service, its features, or policies**. It acts as a catch-all for informational queries that don't fit into more specific transactional or support intents.\n\nThis includes, but is not limited to, questions about:\n\n- **How-To & Instructions**: Questions about how to perform a specific action, how to use a feature, or where to find certain information.\n- **General Information**: Inquiries about the service's policies, terms of service, pricing, or capabilities.\n- **Troubleshooting**: Basic troubleshooting questions that can be answered with standard information.\n- **Account Management**: General questions about account settings, profiles, and subscriptions.\n\n**Key Notes:**\n\n- If a question is about a specific, ongoing issue with a user's account or order (e.g., \"My order is late\"), it should be classified under a more specific intent like \"delivery status\" or \"customer support\".\n- FAQ questions are typically those that can be answered by a static knowledge base or help document.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n- \"How do I reset my password?\"\n- \"What is your return policy?\"\n- \"Can I use this service on multiple devices?\"\n- \"How do I update my payment information?\"\n- \"Where can I find my past invoices?\"\n\n## Membership\n\n**Definition:**\n\nThis intent covers all inquiries related to **membership benefits, perks, and associated programs**, including but not limited to:\n\n- **Benefit Status & Eligibility**: Monthly perks, special benefits, birthday rewards, and tier-based benefits (e.g., checking usage eligibility, viewing membership points including remaining balance, confirming validity period, checking coupons/codes, etc.).\n- **Targeted Programs**: Benefits exclusive to specific age groups (e.g., youth/teen/college-only programs).\n- **Activity-Based Discounts**: Discounts for cultural events (e.g., exhibitions, performances, musicals, plays).\n- **Personalized Recommendations**: Situation-based recommendations (e.g., for dates, families, holidays) and recommendations based on usage history.\n- **Coupon Management**: Checking available coupons.\n- **Partner Offers**: Inquiries about benefits/discounts/coupons provided via associated partner brands across various categories such as travel, dining, shopping, sports, and services.\n- **Partnership Clarification**: Even when third-party brands are mentioned, any question about their relationship to the membership program (e.g., partnership status) is classified as Membership.\n- **Common Phrases**: Phrases like “Benefits provided by the program,” “Is this possible with membership?”, “Is there a partnered membership for ~?”, “Tell me the membership benefits for ~” are all treated as Membership.\n\n**Key Notes:**\n\n- If a \"membership benefit\" question is actually about core service features (e.g., mobile data, specific digital content subscriptions, value-added packs, events, or device insurance), classify it as **Customer Support** instead of **Membership**.\n- Questions about _how to use_ membership (e.g., instructions or procedures, not the benefits themselves) and general program features should be classified as **FAQ**.\n- Unless it pertains to long-term benefit coupons or device upgrade benefits, any inquiry containing the keyword \"benefit\" should generally be classified as **Membership**.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n- “What’s my membership tier?”\n- “Tell me what coupons I have.”\n- “What benefits are included in membership?”\n- “Are there benefits for teens?”\n- “Are there any benefits for weekend use?”\n- “Can I get a coffee shop discount with membership?”\n\n## Wine Recommendation\n\n**Definition:**\n\nThis intent covers all user requests for **wine recommendations**. This includes, but is not limited to:\n\n-   **General Recommendations**: Asking for any wine recommendation.\n-   **Recommendations by Type**: Requests for specific types of wine (e.g., red, white, rosé, sparkling).\n-   **Recommendations by Food Pairing**: Asking for a wine that pairs well with a specific dish (e.g., steak, fish, pasta).\n-   **Recommendations by Occasion**: Seeking a wine for a particular event (e.g., a party, a celebration, a casual dinner).\n-   **Recommendations by Price Range**: Inquiries for wine within a certain budget.\n-   **Recommendations by Region or Grape**: Requests for wine from a specific country or made from a particular grape variety.\n\n**Key Notes:**\n\n-   This intent is strictly for recommendations. Inquiries about where to buy wine, wine prices (without a recommendation context), or general facts about wine should be handled by other intents.\n-   If the user asks for a recommendation and also mentions a specific store or location, the primary intent is still `wine_recommendation`.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n-   \"Can you recommend a good red wine?\"\n-   \"What wine should I pair with grilled salmon?\"\n-   \"I'm looking for a cheap but decent bottle of white wine.\"\n-   \"Suggest a French wine for a dinner party.\"\n-   \"What's a good sparkling wine to celebrate with?\"\n\n\nChat history: {chat_history}\nMost recent intent: {most_recent_intent}\n**Remember: Always choose the most applicable category based on the primary action or information being requested by the user. Use this information to accurately identify the user's goal and output the intent along with your confidence score in the OUTPUT format below.**"
